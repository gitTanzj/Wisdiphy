WHAT DO I NEED TO DO:

ADD TO SETTINGS:

- [] THEME CHANGE
- []

BF THE END OF THE MONTH:

- [x] Make separate note writing screen
- [] Create highlighting function
- []

WHAT WORKS?

- DISPATCH WITH CREATE NOTE AND UPDATE NOTE

WHAT DOESNT?

- CAN'T POST NEW NOTE TO MONGO WITHOUT CREATING A NEW ID, BUT REACT-NATIVE DOESN'T ALLOW MONGODB MODULE TO BE USED, SO I HAVE TO CREATE A NEW UNIQUE ID FOR EACH NOTE.
- CAN'T DELETE NOTE BECAUSE CREATED NOTE ID IS 'NULL'
